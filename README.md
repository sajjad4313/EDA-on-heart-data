Report on Heart Patients Data Analysis
Introduction
This report presents the results of our exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the heart patients dataset. The analysis was conducted in several stages, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Our goal was to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that could inform further data processing and model building.

Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis was performed on each individual column to understand the distribution and characteristics of each variable. This step included calculating summary statistics and visualizing the data through histograms and boxplots.

Bivariate Analysis
Following the univariate analysis, bivariate analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between pairs of variables. We examined correlations and created scatter plots and heatmaps to visualize these relationships.

Multivariate Analysis
In the multivariate analysis phase, we extended our examination to multiple variables simultaneously to identify more complex interactions and patterns. Techniques such as pair plots and multidimensional scaling were employed. The conclusions drawn from each analysis are documented in the project file.

Outlier Handling
Throughout the analysis, we identified and handled outliers. For outliers determined to be genuine values, we opted to retain them in the dataset to preserve the integrity of the data.

Data Visualization
Various visualization techniques were utilized throughout the EDA process to illustrate findings clearly and effectively. These visualizations helped in understanding the data's underlying structure and informing subsequent steps.

Conclusion
With the completion of the EDA, including outlier handling and visualization, the dataset is now prepared for feature engineering. The insights gained from the analysis will guide the creation of meaningful features for model training.
